Victoria 3 invites you to build your ideal society in the tumult of the exciting and transformative 19th century. Balance the competing interests in your society and earn your place in the sun. It is the most anticipated games in Paradoxâ€™s history. As one of two UX Designer on Paradox Interactive's latest Grand-Strategy game (GSG), Victoria 3, I am and have been responsible for the game's entire player experience.

The game had been in development for about 3 years when I came on board and the other UX designer was going on parental leave. Leaving me as the sole person to handle the UX a year before and up until release. Paradox Development Studio has been very new to the concept of what UX means and how to incorporate it into their processes. This is something I have been very much apart of defining and setting up, picking up where my fellow UX designer left off. A lot of things were on fire when I joined and the tempo was incredibly high, not allowing us time to put out all the fires, and instead we continued to build on top of them.

Coming in at such a tumultous time, I had to develop and hone my skills incredibly fast and my personal development has been at a rocket speed ever since. I have now grown into an Experienced UX Designer in less than 2 years, where I have continued leading our effort of making Victoria 3 our most approachable and intuitive Grand-Strategy game, but let us talk a bit about my process and what I have actually done in the game.
