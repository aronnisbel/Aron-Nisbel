I have two passions, the first being UX-Design, and the second is solving code-related problems, preferably in a full-stack environment. I'm always eager to learn new things and improve the skills I already have. I like to converse with people about usability, iterating my way forward through user-testing to figure out how to improve. You would find me thriving in a learning environment, working with a team of driven and ambitious people. </p>

<p>
Ever since I started programming and learning the first steps of UX design at the University, my inner excitement always triggers when I see any type of code or design-related problem. Hours go by, and I sometimes forget to eat and drink. I like the creativity it takes to tackle a design challenge or code problem, and the instant feeling of satisfaction when it's solved. The best part is to be able to share this experience with other people in a team and overcome all the obstacles we bump into along the way together.

<p>
In my free time, I like to travel the world in search of majestic cliffs and boulders to climb, at least when the weather is nice. When the weather is not so nice, I love to run in the rain when the air is fresh, usually sticking to the longer running distances. When I'm not exercising, I can sit by my computer for hours on end, either coding, designing, gaming or creating games.
