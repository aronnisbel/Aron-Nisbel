Lucks is a Stockholm-based company that sells and designs customized doors. They now have a website where you can contact them for design suggestions and offers, but the process requires a lot of hands-on work for Luck's staff. They are looking for a solution where clients can easily create a drawing on custom sliding doors. They requested a concept solution for their website that will allow customers to configure, preview and order sliding doors, without manual intervention by Luck's staff.

Over the span of 5 sprints spread out over 15 weeks, we conducted research through Google forms and qualitative interviews and ended with an interactable design. The interactable design iterated back and forth between testing and re-designing and fixes. I was involved in every process and this project gave me insight into the importance of leadership in a project where everyone has their own vision and ideas they rather not let go of, giving fuel to the motto: less is more.
