Lucks is a Stockholm-based company that sells and designs customized doors. They now have a website where you can contact them for design suggestions and offers, but the process requires a lot of hands-on work for Luck’s staff.

They are looking for a solution where clients can easily create their own design on custom sliding doors. They requested a concept solution for their website that will allow customers to configure, preview and order sliding doors, without manual intervention by Luck’s staff.

Over the span of 5 sprints spread out over 15 weeks, I conducted research through surveys and qualitative interviews. Through iteration of Lo-fis and Mid-fis, I ended up with a Hi-fi prototype and a design system. The interactable Hi-fi prototype was heavily iterated between testing and re-designing. I was involved in every process and parts of the design system is now used by Lucks.
